Alright part 2:

For the JSON and functionality we don't need: category, partOfSpeech, pronunciation, year, we need to focus on the definition and sentence. Let's enrich using the following website: https://www.encyclo.nl/ - You can also delete related functions from the judge and display pages.

For the Timer in the display page. Let's make it bigger! It's neutral for the first 30s, after 30s it becomes yellow, and the last 30s is red. Let's make it center screen and important! Can we make a big clock on the screen for the timer? Also let's add configs for the full time plus the steps, since we need to try it out and maybe adjust the timings a bit.

Let's add a button to unveil the word when the user gets it right or wrong. It will be displayed on the screen!

Some UX feedback:

Homepage:
The content input field on the homepage `Display Interface` is unreadable

Judge:
Provide Information headers are unreadable
Let's also add an input field to type as we go with the person who is guessing. So when we unveil the correct/incorrect to the display. It displays in the display which part they got wrong! For the rest the judge is looking good for now.

Display:
So bigger timer, should be a countdown clock, big and dramatic. Dutch Spelling Bee should be called Wauw & Pittigman Spelling Bee.
