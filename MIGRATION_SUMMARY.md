# Migration from Socket.io to Pusher - Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the Dutch Spelling Bee application from Socket.io to Pusher for real-time communication. This migration enables deployment on Vercel without requiring a custom server.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Socket.io Dependencies
- Removed `socket.io` and `socket.io-client` from package.json
- Deleted `lib/socket.ts` and `server.ts` files
- Removed custom server setup

### 2. Added Pusher Integration
- Added `pusher` and `pusher-js` dependencies
- Created `lib/pusher.ts` for server-side Pusher configuration
- Created `lib/realtime.ts` for client-side real-time communication wrapper

### 3. Created Pusher API Routes
All API routes follow the pattern `/api/pusher/[event-name]/route.ts`:
- `/api/pusher/word-selected` - When judge selects a new word
- `/api/pusher/timer-start` - When judge starts the timer
- `/api/pusher/timer-reset` - When judge resets the timer
- `/api/pusher/info-provided` - When judge provides word information
- `/api/pusher/judge-decision` - When judge marks correct/incorrect

### 4. Updated Application Pages
- **Judge Page** (`src/app/judge/page.tsx`): Updated to use Pusher real-time communication
- **Display Page** (`src/app/display/page.tsx`): Updated to use Pusher event listeners

### 5. Environment Configuration
Required environment variables in `.env.local`:
```
PUSHER_APP_ID=your_app_id
PUSHER_KEY=your_key
PUSHER_SECRET=your_secret
PUSHER_CLUSTER=your_cluster
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY=your_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER=your_cluster
```

## Technical Architecture

### Real-time Communication Flow
1. **Judge Interface**: Uses `SpellingBeeRealtime` class to send events via API calls
2. **API Routes**: Receive events and trigger Pusher broadcasts to room channels
3. **Display Interface**: Subscribes to Pusher channel and listens for events

### Event Types
- `word-selected`: New word chosen with available information
- `timer-start`: Timer started with duration
- `timer-reset`: Timer reset to initial state
- `info-provided`: Word information provided (definition, sentence, etc.)
- `judge-decision`: Final decision (correct/incorrect)

### Channel Naming
- Channels use format: `spelling-bee-{roomCode}`
- Each room is isolated with its own channel

## Benefits of Migration
1. **Vercel Compatibility**: No custom server required
2. **Scalability**: Pusher handles connection management
3. **Reliability**: Professional WebSocket service
4. **Simplicity**: Cleaner API-based architecture

## ✅ Completed Steps
1. ✅ Set up Pusher account and configured environment variables
2. ✅ Fixed all ESLint warnings and TypeScript errors
3. ✅ Verified successful build with no issues
4. ✅ Ready for Vercel deployment

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Test real-time functionality between judge and display interfaces in production
